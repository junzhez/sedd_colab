A shocking October report shared on the Internet included images wide of sea level and videos from a 2013 explosion at a plant, File No. 24, that turned out to between $1 billion and $2 billion in radiation protection and 590-gall storage tanks containing roughly 7,000 tons of gas.\n",

That remains true. What I would call ill-conceived.”\n",
